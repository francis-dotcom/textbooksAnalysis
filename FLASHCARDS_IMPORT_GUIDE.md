## 💡 Pro Tips for Your Test

### 1. **Focus on Calculations**
The applied cards with calculations are most likely to appear on tests:
- Cross-rate calculations (Chapter 5)
- BOP identity problems (Chapter 3)
- Forward premium/discount (Chapter 5)

### 2. **Understand Relationships**
Don't just memorize - understand WHY:
- Why does BOP sum to zero?
- How does currency depreciation affect trade?
- Why does triangular arbitrage work?

### 3. **Practice with Variations**
For calculation cards, try:
- Changing the numbers
- Working backwards
- Explaining the process to someone else

### 4. **Use Spaced Repetition**
- Start studying NOW, not the night before
- Review cards daily, even if just 15 minutes
- Trust Anki's algorithm - it knows when you need to review

### 5. **Create Mental Models**
- Visualize the BOP accounts as a balance sheet
- Draw diagrams for triangular arbitrage
- Create acronyms for lists (e.g., "CCFI" for Current, Capital, Financial, International reserves)
