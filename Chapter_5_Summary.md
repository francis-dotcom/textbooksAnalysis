# Chapter 5: The Market for Foreign Exchange - Key Concepts

## Overview
The foreign exchange (FX) market is the **largest financial market in the world** by virtually any standard.

## 1. **What is the Foreign Exchange Market?**

The FX market encompasses:
- Conversion of purchasing power from one currency to another
- Bank deposits of foreign currency
- Extension of credit denominated in foreign currency
- Foreign trade financing
- Trading in foreign currency options and futures contracts
- Currency swaps

## 2. **Function and Structure of FX Market**

### Primary Function:
- Assist clients in the conduct of international commerce

### Market Structure:
- **OTC (Over-the-Counter) markets** - No central marketplace where buyers and sellers congregate
- Trading happens through networks of dealers

### Two-Tier Market:
1. **Interbank (Wholesale) Market** - Banks trading with each other
2. **Client (Retail) Market** - Bank customers

### Key Infrastructure:
- **Correspondent bank account network** - Facilitates efficient functioning
- **ECHO (Exchange Clearing House Limited)** - Multi-lateral netting of each currency
- Standard interbank trade size: **~$10 million**

## 3. **Five FX Market Participants**
1. Banks and financial institutions
2. Corporations
3. Central banks
4. Hedge funds and investment managers
5. Individual traders/retail customers

## 4. **Spot Market**

### Definition:
- Involves **almost immediate** purchase or sale of foreign exchange
- Cash settlement usually in **2 business days** (for USD and non-North American currencies)

### Positions:
- **Long position** - Buy foreign exchange
- **Short position** - Sell foreign exchange

### Spot Rate Quotations:

#### Direct Quotation:
- Price of **one unit of foreign currency** in terms of domestic currency
- Example: $1.3613/£ (dollars per pound)

#### Indirect Quotation:
- Price of **one unit of domestic currency** in terms of foreign currency
- Reciprocal of direct quotation

### Bid-Ask Spread:
- **Bid price** - Price at which dealers BUY currency for inventory (lower)
- **Ask (Offer) price** - Price at which dealers SELL from inventory (higher)
- **Mid-rate** - Average of bid and ask rates
- **Spread** - Allows dealers to earn profit

**Example:**
- Bid rate for Pounds = $1.52, Ask rate = $1.60
- Bank buys pounds from you at $1.52
- Bank sells pounds to you at $1.60

## 5. **Cross-Exchange Rates**

### Definition:
- Exchange rate between a currency pair where **neither currency is the U.S. dollar**
- Example: EUR/GBP, JPY/CHF

### Movements in Cross Exchange Rates:
1. If currencies A and B move in **same direction** → No change in cross rate
2. If currency A appreciates **more** than B → A appreciates against B
3. If currency A appreciates **less** than B → A depreciates against B
4. If A appreciates while B unchanged → A appreciates against B by same degree

### Cross-Rate Bid-Ask Spread:
- Must calculate bid and ask for cross currencies
- Used for currency-against-currency trades (non-dollar to non-dollar)

## 6. **Triangular Arbitrage**

### Definition:
- Process of trading out of USD → second currency → third currency → back to USD
- **Zero-risk, zero-investment strategy** with guaranteed profit

### Purpose:
- Earn arbitrage profit when direct cross-exchange rate is **not aligned** with implied cross-exchange rate

### Arbitrage Conditions:
- **Arbitrage exists if:**
  - Given Ask price < Implied cross bid rate, OR
  - Given Bid price > Implied cross ask rate

**Example:**
- You have $1 million
- USD/EUR = 1.1586, EUR/GBP = 1.4680, USD/GBP = 1.6939
- Trade USD → EUR → GBP → USD to capture profit

## 7. **The Forward Market**

### Definition:
- Contracting **today** for **future** purchase or sale of FX
- Settlement at a future date (30, 60, 90, 180 days, etc.)

### Uses:
- **Hedge FX exposure** - Protect against currency risk
- **Speculate** in FX market

### Forward Rate Notation:
- **FN(j/k)** = Price of one unit of currency k in terms of currency j for delivery in N months
- Like spot quotes, can be direct or indirect (reciprocals)

### Forward Premium/Discount:

**Formula:**
```
Forward premium (discount) = [(F - S₀) / S₀] × (360/n) × 100
```

Where:
- F = Forward rate
- S₀ = Spot rate
- n = Number of days in forward contract

- **Premium** - Forward rate > Spot rate (forward currency more expensive)
- **Discount** - Forward rate < Spot rate (forward currency cheaper)
- Useful for comparing against interest rate differential between countries

### Forward Cross-Exchange Rates:
- Can calculate forward rates for non-dollar currency pairs
- Similar principles as spot cross-rates

## 8. **Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) Contracts**

### Background:
- Some emerging market currencies have **government-instituted capital controls**
- Not freely traded or obtainable offshore

### Key Difference from Deliverable Forward (DF):
- **NDF**: Settled in **cash** (no physical currency delivery)
- Settlement = (Spot rate at maturity - NDF rate) × Notional amount
- **DF**: Physical delivery of currency

## Key Takeaways:
- FX market is the world's largest financial market
- Two-tier structure: interbank (wholesale) and client (retail)
- Spot market: immediate exchange (2-day settlement)
- Bid-ask spread is how dealers profit
- Cross-rates allow trading between non-dollar currencies

- Forward market allows hedging and speculation
- Forward rates can trade at premium or discount to spot
- NDFs used for restricted currencies (cash-settled)
